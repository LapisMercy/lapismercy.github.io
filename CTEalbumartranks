    <h1>Ranking Cage the Elephant Album Covers</h1>
      <p>Cage the Elephant currently has 7 main albums. The first being the self named <em>Cage the Elephant</em>, followed by <em>Thank You, Happy Birthday</em>, then <em>Melophobia</em>, <em>Tell Me I'm Pretty</em>, <em> Unpeeled</em>, <em> Social Cues</em>, and the latest addition <em>Neon Pill</em>.</p>
    <h2><strong>#7</strong>: <em>Thank You, Happy Birthday</em></h2>
      <p>This is Cage The Elephant's 2nd album, and I feel as if this is the obvious choice for last place. Don't get me wrong I absolutly love this album, it is actually my favorite, but the art is just lacking. Also I want to say that this ranking is based off the orginal art and not the extended version's art. The album art is really simple, it is just the name of the band and album in intresting color and wierd font. This image just doesn't accuratly express the fun of the album. It is just really boring, and doesn't give any hint as the what music the album conatins.</p>
