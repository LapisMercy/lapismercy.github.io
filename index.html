    <h1>Ranking Cage the Elephant Album Covers</h1>
      <p>Cage the Elephant currently has 7 main albums. The first being the self named <em>Cage the Elephant</em>, followed by <em>Thank You, Happy Birthday</em>, then <em>Melophobia</em>, <em>Tell Me I'm Pretty</em>, <em> Unpeeled</em>, <em> Social Cues</em>, and the latest addition <em>Neon Pill</em>.</p>
    <h2><strong>#7</strong>: <em>Thank You, Happy Birthday</em></h2>
      <p>This is Cage The Elephant's 2nd album, and I feel as if this is the obvious choice for last place. Don't get me wrong I absolutly love this album, it is actually my favorite, but the art is just lacking. Also I want to say that this ranking is based off the orginal art and not the extended version's art. The album art is really simple, it is just the name of the band and album in interesting color and weird font. This image just doesn't accuratly express the fun of the album. It is just really boring, and doesn't give any hint as the what music the album contains.</p>
    <h2><strong>#6</strong>: <em>Tell me I'm Pretty</em></h2>
      <p>This album indicates a change in Cage the Elephant's style from more rock to more indie. This album cover's primary color is white which accurately matches the vibes of this album. This album feels a bit colder and softer while still being able to deliver on the abrasive feelings. While this album cover is good it just seems a bit basic when comparing it to the others. It seems a bit too mature and well too safe. This album features less energy than the ones previous, but the album cover drains out too much energy. </p>
    <h2><strong>#5</strong>: <em>Neon Pill</em></h2>
      <p>This album is Cage the Elephant's most recents, and also their return after mutiple years. This cover features warm neon colors such as orange, while having colder colors at the edges. This is a symbol of the rebirth, but at the same time showing some age. The softer edges and colors reflect the mellow and chill vibes of this album. I just have one problem with it.The album art is different from all the previous as it is trying to be abstract, but not abstract at the same time. It fails in being abstract enough so you accept it, but it is abstract. It just leads to it looking confusing at first.</p>
    <h2><strong>#4</strong>: <em>Cage the Elephant</em></h2>
      <p>For Cage the Elephant's first album they did extremely well with the album art. It has a skull combined with bright reds, yellows, and blues. I have no complaints This album art wonderfully matches the rock music in the album. While the songs can be dark (as represented by the skull) they are creative and fun, which matches the colors. The art looks a bit "scrappy"  which matches this being the first album from a new band. Like the album the art is just beautiful chaos. It feels like it shouldn't work, but it just does. This album art adds so much to the character of this album. </p>
    <h2><strong>#3</strong>: <em>Unpeeled</em></h2>
      <p>Before explaining this ranking I want to clarify what this album is. <em>Unpeeled</em> is the second live album from Cage the Elephant. It includes no new music, instead covers of their own songs, (performed live) and covers of some other artists songs. I am including it as Cage the Elephant's offical Complete Playlist includes it. With that out of the way I feel like out of all the album arts, this is the sleeper pick. To be honest, I could not tell you what the album art really is, but it is just so good. The muted but warm colors matches the acoustic nature of this album so well. For the longest time I didn't even realize there was a women on the cover, I just thought it was suppose to some type of essence. Which also matches this album, because it focuses more on the soul of the music. While it may not have been done on purpose, having the album cover look different represents this album and Cage the Elephant very well. There are extra details everywhere.</p>
    <h2><strong>#2</strong>: <em>Melophobia</em></h2>
      <p>This is Cage the Elephant's most popular album, and with that and the art also being super good, it had to rank high. The album art is very abstract, but yet still understandable. From just looking at the album you know that its gonna be a little bit crazy, which is very true, but also a bit emotional. This represents the experimental songs like <em>Teeth</em>, and the more mellow ones like <em>Cigarette Daydreams</em>.</p> This album art has become iconic and has been the source for many paintings and tattoos. That doesn't just happened to any normal album art. Still though as good as this one is, there is a reason why it is 2nd place. Still this album cover is elite.
    <h2><strong>#1</strong>: <em>Social Cues</em></h2>
      <p>This is Cage the Elephant's best album art. <em>Social Cues</em> marks Cage the Elephant's offical transition to more indie/alternative music. it features heavy emotions and themes of saddness and loss. Which is conveyed in the sketchy look and the colors just being off around the cowboy. The thing though is, it still has energy, there is a COWBOY on the cover surronded by a vibrant blue and red. This album is able to be the perfect level of abstract, but makes sense. I can not properly put into words how good it is. Just know that its the best, and is a mirror to the music.</p>
