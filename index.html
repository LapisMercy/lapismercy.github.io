    <h1>Ranking Cage the Elephant Album Covers</h1>
      <p>Cage the Elephant currently has 7 main albums. The first being the self named <em>Cage the Elephant</em>, followed by <em>Thank You, Happy Birthday</em>, then <em>Melophobia</em>, <em>Tell Me I'm Pretty</em>, <em> Unpeeled</em>, <em> Social Cues</em>, and the latest addition <em>Neon Pill</em>.</p>
    <h2><strong>#7</strong>: <em>Thank You, Happy Birthday</em></h2>
      <p>This is Cage The Elephant's 2nd album, and I feel as if this is the obvious choice for last place. Don't get me wrong I absolutly love this album, it is actually my favorite, but the art is just lacking. Also I want to say that this ranking is based off the orginal art and not the extended version's art. The album art is really simple, it is just the name of the band and album in interesting color and weird font. This image just doesn't accuratly express the fun of the album. It is just really boring, and doesn't give any hint as the what music the album contains.</p>
    <h2><strong>#6</strong>: <em>Tell me I'm Pretty</em></h2>
      <p>This album indicates a change in Cage the Elephant's style from more rock to more indie. This album cover's primary color is white which accurately matches the vibes of this album. This album feels a bit colder and softer while still being able to deliver on the abrasive feelings. While this album cover is good it just seems a bit basic when comparing it to the others. It seems a bit too mature and well too safe. This album features less energy than the ones previous, but the album cover train out too much energy. </p>
    <h2><strong>#5</strong>: <em>Neon Pill</em></h2>
      <p>This album is Cage the Elephant's most recents, and also their return after mutiple years. This cover features warm neon colors such as orange, while having colder colors at the edges. This is a symbol of the rebirth, but at the same time showing some age. The softer edges and colors reflect the mellow and chill vibes of this album. I just have one problem with it.The album art is different from all the previous as it is trying to be abstract, but not abstract at the same time. It fails in being abstract enough so you accept, but it is abstract. It just leads to it looking confusing at first.</p>
    <h2><strong>#4</strong>: <em>Cage the Elephant</em></h2>
      <p></p>
    <h2><strong>#3</strong>: <em>Unpeeled</em></h2>
      <p></p>
    <h2><strong>#2</strong>: <em>Melophobia</em></h2>
      <p></p>
    <h2><strong>#1</strong>: <em>Social Cues</em></h2>
